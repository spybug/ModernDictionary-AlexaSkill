Their later albums, Ænima, Lateralus, and 10,000 Days, are progressive/art rock influenced. The band spans several genres and is one of the most influential metal bands in recent memory.Often called the inspiration of the nu-metal genre, an enormous disrespect to Tool. When Tool was formed, they were one of the first alternative metal bands.

This mockery came to a climax when shitcore band Limp Bizkit did a cover of Opiate in concert, which was full of whines and lyrical mishaps. Worst of all, the 6-minute song was condensed to a 2-minute rap.Tool's masterpieces include the songs; H., Forty-Six and 2, Eulogy, Sober, Jambi, Prison Sex, Opiate, Pushit, a cover of Led Zeppelin's classic No Quarter."

The soldiers they sent wore a mixture of uniforms – some military, some RIC. This mixture gave them the appearance of being in khaki and dark police uniform. As a result, these men got the nickname ""Black and Tans"", and it stuck.  They went round Ireland to enforce English Rule, became notorious through its numerous attacks on the Irish civilian population, forbidding people to speak their native language Gaeilge and beating and battering those who opposed English law.  For the Black and Tans, their primary task was to make Ireland ""hell for the rebels to live in"". Over 8000 Black and Tans went to Ireland and while they found it difficult to cope with men who used classic guerrilla tactics against them, those who lived in areas where the Black and Tans were based, paid the price.What did the Black and Tans achieve? They served no purpose for the British government as they simply failed to stop what the IRA was doing. However, they did succeed in getting the republican cause a great deal of civilian support simply because of their acts – people may not have joined the IRA, but they were supporters of it and gave what financial help they could to the movement.

Islam means submission. The basic tenet of Islam is that all non-Muslims must submit to Muslims, and all women must submit to men.Islam is focused on confronting and converting people of other faiths and religions - and it is traditionally spread through war, violence, terror, coercion and pressure. Whenever there is a significant Muslim minority in a country, friction and violence is inevitable until Islam gains dominance. The victims are given the choice to convert to Islam, live as a dhimmi (protected minority) and pay a jizya (protection money / tax), or be killed or run out of their native land. It's impossible to officially covert out of Islam or change religions, according to Islamic law. Islam considers non-believers to be infidels and Islamic ""holy"" texts permit violence and jihad against them.As of 2010, Islam has taken over 47 countries which now have an Islamic majority. The goal of Islam is to take over the entire world and revert humanity back to the 7th century - as a means of achieving peace and harmony -- through completely dominance and obliteration of theological diversity."

Likewise, while they are reluctant to partake in such physically violent crimes such as murder, assault and rape this is not because of their self proclaimed moral superiority but rather because most are extremely hesitant to get their hands dirty.Constantly boasting about how they're superior to men and how all men are disgusting, subhuman mutations. All they have to back up these claims are their wombs (which they seem to believe makes them inherently right) and a few anecdotes about some asshole they used to date.Other than a few notable individuals, there is very little evidence other than their self important cackling to support their claims of superiority. Furthermore, their assertions that one day they will rise up against the oppressive patriarchy and rule a Utopia in which there is no pain or crime are equally dubious but often hilarious."

Drum and Bass has a beautiful contrast in that it can have mass complexity while still maintaining a friendly feel to the dancefloor or the personal cd player. Drum and Bass is also the umbrella term for the genre that has developed countless subgenre's (neurofunk, techstep, hardstep, ragga, jump-up, liquid funk, atmospheric, dubwise, electrostep, metalstep, etc.). To those who don't know much about the music, they would be surprised how much it has in common with the genres that the unknowing listener usualy listens to.

Nothing,"   Nothing was once questioned by a great mind. Is it the ""prescense of abscence or the abscense of prescense""? Furthermore, what is the sound of one hand clapping? What is out there in the universe, at what makes up those vast spaces of abscense? (or prescense of abscense)    Nothing, put simply, is the deepest, shallowest, brightest, darkest, widest, thinnest, and incomprehensibly empty emptyness, so empty that it is only prevented from collapsing upon itself because there is no substance to collapsae in upon, or no substance to do the collapsing, or even any substance to think or daydream about collapsing upon abscense of prescense or prescense of abscense, which is still utterly and completely absent of form and shape and mass and prescense that is abscent from the existance of anything. In short, nothing is the total, absolute, final, and complete spot that is both positive and negative, young and old, and to sum it all up the opposite of everything in existance, for there is no existance in nothingness. It has even been thought that nothingness itself doesn't even exist, and that the existance of nothingness is so impossibly ludicrous and isnane that if anyone were to actually realize or see nothingness, the entirety of the expanse of the Everything would simply vaporize, leaving even more nothingness in its place.

l33t,"As the Internet was coming into its own, during the early 1980s, hackers that didn't want their websites, newsgroups, etc, to be picked up in a simple keyword search began using numbers to replace certain letters (mostly vowels) such as A = 4 or E = 3.At this point, l33t speak was only known to a select few and only used when necessary. However, in 1994, id Software began to add Internet connectivity to Doom and Doom II, leading to a revolution in PC gaming and also to the rise of l33t speak.As with any type of competition, 'smack' talk became prevalent in online gaming. Phrases such as 'I am elite' became common place, and somewhere down the line l33t speak crept in, reforming the phrase into '1 4m 3l1t3' in order to demonstrate that the speaker was a hacker and someone to be feared. It was further exaggerated by purposeful bad spelling and eventually wound up as something like this, '1 4m 3l33t!' and simplified to, '1 4m 133t'. Hence the name 'l33t speak'.l33t speak was still relatively unknown to the Internet masses at this point. It had almost disappeared from gaming entirely. However, a very popular web comic called Megatokyo brought l33t speak into mainstream with its infamous speak l33t? comic. These days l33t speak is very well known to the hardcore Internet community (especially gamers).As you've already seen, basic l33t is just replacing vowels with numbers:A = 4E = 3I = 1O = 0However l33t is a very flexible 'language' and you can go from this very basic l33t, to ultra 1337 by being creative; a few examples:O = ()U = |_|T = 7D = |)W = \/\/S = $There is no agreed-upon way to write l33t, so it's up to you whether or not to go with light l33t, medium 1337, hard |_337 or even ultra |_33¯|¯. In this entry, 'l33t' is used except when referring to medium, hard or ultra '1337'.The -0r clause can be used in place of -ed or -er, for example '1 0wnz0r!' (most commonly seen in ultra 1337 as '1 0\/\/|\|z0r!') rather than '1 0wn3d'. However it can also be used like this, '1 4m l33t h4x0r!' (in ultra 1337, '1 4|\/| |_337 |-|4x0r!') rather than, '1 4m 4 133t h4ck3r!'.As a general rule, in l33t, rather than use 's' to make something plural, a 'z' is used instead. Also 'f' is normally changed to 'ph'. The short 'u' is often changed to '00', as well.Punctuation is usually left out with greater consistency as the level of l33t increases. Full stops are left out entirely because, when you are chatting online, where you would normally put a full stop you just hit 'enter' to send the message and keep typing. Exclamation marks are used quite a bit (and usually quite a number at once), mostly because l33t is most commonly used in expressions of pleasure. Commas are generally left out in hard and ultra 1337, and are uncommon in medium 1337.Recently after the dawn of MMORPGs such as World of Warcraft as a popular form of online gaming, l33t speak has become an epidemic to the point of burnout.  Most l33t speak is generally considered a sign of immaturity or is done derisively and tounge in cheek.  "

Nuked the Fridge,"""Nuking the fridge"" refers to the moment in a film series when it becomes apparent that a certain installment is not as good as previous installments, due to ridiculous or low quality storylines, events, or characters.Originating from the film ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,"" Harrison Ford's character survives a nuclear detonation by getting into a lead-lined fridge before being blown thousands of feet only to crash back down and emerge safely.The absurdity in this occurrence is that, although lead is radiation proof, lead melts at 620°F and is not resistant to the millions of degrees, that say, an atomic bomb would put out. This is the prime example of the lower quality and outlandishness disgorged as a continuation of the series, and thus the phrase was coined.The saying is also a reference to the phrase ""[jump the shark],"" referring to an episode of Happy Days where [the Fonz] jumped a shark on water skis, considered the lowest point of the show.

The lost canadian people," When the current ""Canadians"", the warrior matriach society and it's ruling misogynistic, wife-killing emperor took over what is widely known of as ""Canada"", the kind and gentle, oddly-accented ""real"" canadians were trapped in cages in what is falsely known of as NewFoundland,by the evil walrii (allegedly). The Current inhabitants who are reknowned as being with out judicial law, and live by a very direct and brutally literal interpretation of ""surival of the fittest"" as well as with the implementation of mandatory drinking laws, will imitate a relatively peaceful, reasonabley patriarchal (see equality of the sexes), democratic society, lead by their ""prime minister"" who is rumoured to really be a robot placed there by the evil walrii in order to distract the rest of the world from the ""fake"" canadians, and therefore essentially their own activities (which are largly unknown of by the ""fake canadians"", and the rest of the world). The imitation starts whenever a ""foreigner"" enters the country that is not otherwise garaunteed to keep utterly quite, and cannot be forced to be married to a female ""fake"" canadian, towns and cities are alerted to a foreingers nearness by a complicated alert system, even though the routine ""tagging"" of arriving foreingers at borders makes available many modes of tracking them that are easier, and more efficient. The governemnt is very deep and many layered, and many parts of it are actually entirely unaware of the other parts, government having little to do with, or awareness of the general populace, and vice versa(see fake canadian culture). The ""fake"" canadians are actually entirely unaware of the ""real"" canadians, or where the idea to imitate a democracy and install a fake prime minister came from, as they are more intent on battling to the death over property, aquiring wealth through the appropriating of entire families by a marriage and duel combination, and drinking levels of whiskey considered lethal for any human being (for more on ""fake"" canadian culture see fake canadian culture). The ""Real"" Canadians (RCP) have been in cages it is believed since some time in 1867, and the evil walrii have managed to keep them entirely hidden. Some disguised walrii soldiers having opened a zoo, and forced the ""real"" canadians to wear animal costumes, coupled with the vaporised hallucinogens they spray at people as the enter the zoo, this has been sucessful at passing the poor gentle ""real"" canadians off as zoo creatures, and making money.There is some debate as to whether or not it is in fact the current ""fake"" canadian inhabitants who are technically the ""real"" canadians, due to the estimated time of their take over. As ""Canada"" only truly became it's own country in that same year and it is unknown exactly when in 1867 that the ""fake canadians"" arrived. "

dianetics,"The pseudoscience invented by L. Ron Hubbard and used to give a thin veneer of plausability to [Scientology]. Dianetics claims to be ""the modern science of mental health"" but in reality is little more than ridiculous claims with no or fraudulent evidence to back them up.

The concept of a reactive mind is of course completely false and was only invented to convince people that all their problems in life could be attributed to a single source which could only be cured by [Scientology]. As if that wasn't enough bullshit for one day, Dianetics and Scientology also claim to be able to cure you of other things besides your reactive mind, such as toxins, drug residues and radiation stored in your body, although any sort of reliable medical evidence that their methods work in any way at all is sadly lacking."

sum 41,"A piece-of-shit, poser band that has not only the balls to call themselves punk (which they're clearly not--more like POP) but also to rip off other bands on their latest album, ""Chuck"" (such as Metallica and Coldplay).

Their style of music is basically pop thinly and poorly disguised as punk.  And to those who are talking shit about Avril Lavigne, you do know that the dumbfuck lead singer just married her, don't you?  He's been banging her for over a year now.  As the saying goes, birds of a feather flock together.Sum 41 are a favorite of MTV since they plays what's trendy and have an image that is very commercial and ""in"".  Fans consist of MTV-loving shitheads who like whatever's in the top 40, think the members are ""hott"" (even though they all look like a bunch of malnourished, pasty faced, pussified peter-puffers who can't even get a decent haircut) and think they're badass and rebellious because they shop at Hot Topic (which should burn down).Sum 41 fans can kiss my ass because in five years this band will join the rest of the has-been fads.  They'll be just as obsolete as boy bands and despite all the bitching you faggots can muster up, you know I'm right.  This band is already fading away and soon they'll be completely irrelevant."

boy,"a young male, normally quite funny, sarcastic, and has the best suppy of ""sick"" (sex related) jokes. Boys are simple just guys who are normally really cool to hang out with, this is of course before they change... some become a ""man"" (a word I hate, not what it means, the spelling) which is a boy who cares and is still fun. Others become a ""pimp"" or a boy who thinks that he is cool because he has lots of girls and lots of other who want him (pimps usually haven't been laid and love to talk about it like they get it every night). Also others become ""jerks"" who use girls/woman and have no regard to there feelings, often found saying ""what did I do?!"". Still others stay boys as the mature and I think these are the best type because they are not quite a serious as a ""man"", are not as cocky as a ""pimp"", and not nearly as mean as a ""jerk"". Thses kinds of boys are very hard to come by, luckly I have one friend just like that. Not my boyfriend, but one of my best friends Fruit Loops. Thanks for staying a boy...."

adrian peterson,"Born March 21, 1985 in Palestine, Texas Adrian is a professional American football running back for the Minnesota Vikings of the National Football League (NFL). He played in college for the University of Oklahoma. During his freshman season, Peterson broke many NCAA freshman rushing records and was a finalist for the Heisman Trophy, finishing second to USC quarterback Matt Leinart, the highest finish ever for a freshman. Peterson comes from a very athletic family. His mother was a collegiate track athlete, while his father signed a national letter of intent to play basketball at the University of Oklahoma. Personal troubles derailed his father's enrollment at Oklahoma, however, and he ended up playing for the University of Southern Idaho, and later serving time in prison. He was released from prison during the 2006 season, but was precluded from attending any Oklahoma's football games until his release from a half-way house in Oklahoma City. Peterson's father was able to watch his son from the stands for the first time on October 14, 2006. Oklahoma beat Iowa State University in that game, but Adrian broke his collar bone diving into the end zone to end a 53-yard touchdown run. During a press conference on October 18, Peterson said he was told by doctors to expect to be out for four to six weeks. He was unable to return for the rest of the Sooners regular season, but he was cleared to play in the Big 12 Championship Game. However, he and the coaching staff felt it would be safer to hold him out for one more game. He returned for the Sooners' last game against Boise State in the Fiesta Bowl where he rushed for 77 yards. He refused to discuss his plans beyond the end of this season with the press. At the time of the injury, Peterson had only 151 yards to gain to pass Billy Sims as the University of Oklahoma's all-time leading rusher. Peterson finished 74 yards short of that mark after the Fiesta Bowl. Peterson is 6'2"" about 225 pounds, with his 40 yard dash time reported at 4.38 by Sports Illustrated.On January 15, 2007, Peterson declared that he would forgo his senior year of college and enter the 2007 NFL Draft where it was predicted by many that he would be a top 5 draft choice. On April 28, 2007, Peterson was selected by the Minnesota Vikings with the 7th overall pick. He will wear jersey number 28. Since being drafted by the Vikings, it had been speculated that Peterson would have to undergo surgery to heal the collar bone injury suffered during college, but it was revealed on May 16, 2007 that he will not have to have surgery."

industrial,"A style of music started in the mid-1970's by the seminal ""band"" Throbbing Gristle. Known for the painful noise and disturbed subject matter that seemed to spring eternal from their seriously crazed leader, Genesis P-Orridge (he was once threatened by the axe-murder Ian Brady... Prompting him to write a song about Ian), TG quickly claimed a name for itself. They were often described as ""the wreckers of civilization."" Industrial music was further explored by synth-whatever acts Suicide and Cabaret Voltaire, from New York and Sheffield respectively. Both shared a sort of skewed love for pop music, and both had a penchant for writing seriously weird songs, in the tradition of TG. Cab Voltaire especially was an enormous influence on the scene to follow. The Cabs were soon followed by the fledgling Einsturzende Neubauten, possibly the most notorious of the well-known industrial groups. With more members, no drum set, and a hatred for the guitar, Blixa Bargeld and his band of jaded Germans unleashed a wave of broken machinery and really cool-sounding German lyrics, and throwing in danceable beats, thus giving birth to (you can't blame 'em) the Holocaust that is modern-day industrial. With very little respect for the experimentation of their forefathers but a strong desire to somehow work machinery into their music, a whole host of over (I will NOT say über)-angsty Goths turned to the new genre of Industrial for sanctuary. Bands like Skinny Puppy, KMFDM, and many other groups who wore their hair like Goths but were really, REALLY angry, started coming out of the woodwork. J.G. Thirlwell was a notable exception, bringing some seriously needed humour to the genre with his whole host of aliases (most of them containing ""foetus""). Things only went downhill from there, and before you know it, BAM! the Nine Inch Nails."

Not only that but I also have an expensive import and a japanese car.Another Lie: breaks down on a regular basis- couldnt be further from the truth, mine never broke down. I wonder where he's getting his judgements & information from. Since he never owned one or did he? How much do you want to bet he couldnt afford it and hes making up fake definitions?12-15000 and yes thats correct and I payed for mine in cash.Lie: After insurance and repair bills it will end up costing them more than if they bought a well manufactured car. WRONG, so far I never spent hardly anything on repairs, never once had a problem with it and the insurance was great.Stupidity: 'If you own one sell it to your enemy'- I will sell it to one of the people who keep begging me for it since they see what a reliable sporty car it is and all want it for themselves and i'll be comforted in the fact there will be no problems with it.Kev, if your definition is accurate why is the richest kid in town driving one? Plus 2 other cars. I think somebodys jealous."

Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge,"My Chemical Romance's 2002 debut, was a particularly strident entry in that shifty genre of bands, slamming together elements of emo, hardcore, and even metal.  Rightly signed to a larger label (In this case, Reprise Records), MCR has returned in 2004 with Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge.  With the aid of production major-leaguer, Howard Benson, they've edited the slightly rookie excesses of the band's first album.  This resulting in a pretty damn good relentless product.  Ghosts wander in this Sweet Revenge, and the blood-stained lovers on it's cover are no joke.  "".....Throttle the ignition, Would I die for you, Well here's you answer in spades.....Got you in my sights"", singer Gerard Way wails in Hang 'Em High.  There is also a cinematic concepting here - The story of a man, a woman, and the corpses of a thousand evil men... the liners intone.  You Know What They Do To Guys Like Us In Prison begins, ""In the middle of a gunfight, in the center of a restaurant, they say come with your arms raised high"".  The cut is claustrophobic, messy, and juiced with adrenaline, like the Tokyo crime caper shootout, it was probably inspired by.  Picture antiheroes leaping sideways with twin pistols blaring - in slow motion of course - and you've almost got it.  Put an old ""At the drive - in"" record in the background, and suddenly you're shot in the arm, and down to your last clip.  This cd combines treble - kicking production, constant hyperness, ""Get to the next note now"" instrumentation, and great thematic songwriting.  Three Cheers teams with the influences Mcr shares with their peers, but recent efforts from fellow travelers such as The Used and Thursday, don't have the same furious immediacy or coarseness that makes them so appealing.  My Chemical Romance seems to have built - in restrictive bindings that prevent them from flying off the handle quiet - loud screamo stereotyping , or odd bird stopovers into choral parts or maudlin piano.  Something Like ""Ghost Of You"" might slow the pace, but it doesn't touch the railing guitars or explosive drumming.  Album highlights include the propulsive chain shots ""Give 'Em Hell Kid"" and ""To The End"", where layers of vocals increase urgency of modernist emo.  There's no question that Three Cheers surpasses MCR's first album by a landslide.  Expect nothing but extremely amazing music from this cd. "

So why shouldn'tthey be celebrated?And in the same spirit, gamers themselves are extraordinary people. There are millions of people world-wide that enjoy video games.

Rufie,"A 'rufie' is what is known as a date rape drug. The real name of the drug(s) are Gamma Hydroxy Butyrate (GHB) and Rohypnol, which are central nervous system depressants. Because they are often colorless, tasteless, and odorless, they can be added to beverages, ingested unknowingly and used to aid drug-assisted assault (""date rape""). It is illegal to manufacture or distribute these substances for human consumption in the USA.Gamma Hydroxy Butyrate (GHB), is a central nervous system depressant which is abused for its euphoric, sedative, and anabolic (body-building) effects. Because very small amounts of GHB are found in the human body, GHB is often billed as a natural supplement. It was widely available over-the-counter in health food stores during the 1980s, until 1992 when it was made illegal in the USA.Rohypnol, a trade name for Flunitrazepam, belongs to a class of drugs known as benzodiazepines — the same drug family as Valium, Halcyon, and Xanax. Rohypnol is significantly stronger than the other drugs in this family. Rohypnol is sold in both Europe and Latin America as a sleep aid, but is illegal in the USA.GHB is also known as easy lay, G, Georgia Home Boy, gamma-oh, liquid ecstasy, liquid E, liquid X (Note: GHB is not Ecstasy), GBH or Grievous Bodily Harm, Organic Quaalude, scoop.GBL and BD, are substitutes for GHB. Street or slang names include blue nitro, firewater, invigorate, revivarant, renewtrient, revitalize Plus, somato pro, thunder nectar, and verv.Rohypnol is also known as circles, the date rape drug, the forget pill, La Rocha, Mexican valium, R-2, rib, roachies, roofies, roofenol, rophies, roche (pronounced roe-shay), and rope.GHB can be produced as a clear liquid (which has a salty taste but no smell), a white powder, or a tablet or capsule. It is most commonly used as a liquid - which is packaged in a small, clear, plastic bottle - and taken orally by the capful. Powder use is on the rise — typically dissolved in a beverage.Rohypnol comes as a pill, in one and two milligram doses that is taken orally or dissolved in liquid. The tablets are often white with a line across one side, and a number ""1"" or ""2"" inside a circle and the name 'Roche.' It is frequently used in combination with alcohol, and sometimes with other drugs such as marijuana, cocaine, and heroin (to either accentuate the 'high' or help the user 'come down' from these drugs).Both GHB and Rohypnol are inexpensive, which has made them increasingly popular with younger users.The effects of GHB and Rohypnol follow a similar pattern. GHB takes effect within 10-20 minutes, but doesn't peak for almost an hour. Rohypnol begins to take effect within a half-hour, but does not peak for almost two hours. Both drugs initially cause a feeling of intoxication similar to alcohol (the user feels relaxed, sociable, and uninhibited), followed by a feeling of drowsiness. The effects can last from four to 24 hours. Higher doses can lead to seizures or coma. Combining use with other drugs such as alcohol can result in nausea and breathing difficulties. GHB and two similar substances, gamma butyrolactone (GBL) and 1,4 butanediol (BD) have been linked to poisonings, overdoses, date rapes, and deaths.The long-term effects of GHB use are not known. However, since it is made from industrial chemicals, there is a risk of severe burns to the mouth, throat, and stomach from GHB that has been improperly produced. GHB may produce withdrawal effects among users coming down from the drugs effects, including insomnia, anxiety, tremors, and sweating.Rohypnol is both physically and psychologically addictive. Withdrawal symptoms peak three to five days after use, and include extreme anxiety, muscle pain, headache, hallucinations, and seizures. Some withdrawal symptoms, including cardiovascular collapse, can be fatal.Both GHB and Rohypnol present a serious overdose threat. Since they are depressants, both drugs can be fatal when mixed with alcohol. GHB is especially dangerous because its peak effect is delayed and users often take another dose thinking they haven't taken enough (and GHB can be fatal on its own). GHB is also risky because the strength can vary by batch. Symptoms of overdose can include intense drowsiness, unconsciousness, coma, muscle spasms, disorientation, vomiting, and slowed or stopped breathing. Fatalities usually occur from respiratory failure.Both GHB and Rohypnol have a reputation as date rape drugs. These drugs are easily slipped into someone's drink (GHB is usually a liquid, and Rohypnol dissolves quickly), making the victim easily persuaded and physically weak, or entirely unconscious, leaving them vulnerable to rape, assault, or burglary. Rohypnol is especially dangerous because it causes black-outs, so the victim may have no memory of what happened to him or her."

Virginia Tech is not only adept at scoring via the blocked kick, but also through defensive interceptions.

Punks were forced to wear their pants this way so it would be easier for their masters to pull their pants down and butt-fuck them.  Somehow this became a 1990's fashion trend.  I learned this from watching a TV special on prison life.  The inmate who related the story was an elderly black gentleman who had been sentenced to life in prison and had been there for over fifty years.  He marveled how such a mark of shame became a fashion statement.  He said that younger inmates don't believe him when he tells them but swears it's the truth.  I believed him.  I also think they should let him out already, he's like 80 and I don't think he represents a threat to society.  "

Collinsville,"Collinsville is a town of about 26,000 about 15 minutes east of St. Louis.  It is considered to be a suburb of St. Louis and part of the IL metro area.  It is one of the only places in the nation where you can find every stereotype in the same town.  There are rich snobs, country clubs, complete ghetto, trailer parks, projects, white-collar neighborhoods, blue-collar neighborhoods, farmers, and rednecks.  In high school, the diverse atmosphere leads to groups forming and regularly engaging in ""Gangs of New York"" style fighting.  You find similar people to yourself, get as drunk as possible, and meet in a field for a huge public melee.  These fights were usually recorded and then played during class the next day for the entertainment of students and teachers alike.  One thing they all have in common is that everyone begins drinking by the eighth grade at the latest.  Most are well into the late stages of alcoholism before graduation from high school.  This carries on into adulthood where that annual Italian Fest celebration floods mainstreet with massive amounts of drinking and public urination.  What used to be one of the most competitive sports high schools in the nation has become one of the worst.  This is due to a lack of motivation from male athletes stemming from the girls preferring to sleep with drug addicts.  This leads to built up frusttration and thus, more drunken fighting.  Sometimes people chill out and go on back road trips or ""BRT's"" where they cruise country roads and smoke lots of pot.  There is a large Wigger population.  Some grow out of it, the rest go to jail.  Other than all that it's a pretty sweet place to live.  We keep it real.Oh yeah, and there's some ancient Indian Burial Mounds and the worlds largest Catsup Bottle."

Jains are not Hindus. And we are not evil blood-sucking vegetarians or whatever the hell you think. Okay, Hinduism is not actually a religion. Just thought I'd clear that up. A Hindu was one who lives in the Indus Valley Civilization, near the Indus river. They were the most advanced people in the world (we invented the sewer system, bitch!). They had many different religions that  were very similiar, such as Advaita. These religions were actually monotheistic. God is one but exists in different forms. You can pray to one form for strength and protection, and pray to another form for wisdom and knowledge. It keeps things simple. Each form has a female counterpart, but once again, these are simply incarnations. There is only one God. When you pray to Vishnu, you're just praying to God. When you pray to Durga, you're still praying to God. The religions from the Hindu civilization have been merged to form the religion we know today as Hinduism. Those who are Hindus by blood are the descendants of this great civilization. Those who convert aren't, but they're cool anyway. Hindus pray in temples. The 'dot on the forehead' is known as a bindi. It's there for medical reasons, actually. Those really old scientists knew that that place just above where your eyebrows meet is also an important place for the nerves in your brain."

Often majoring in business or communications, they are oddly absent from class, barely  scrape by, and get a job through their fratboy daddy's connections. Fratboy interests include rape, steroids, SUVs, Abercrombie, any music devoid of meaning and taste (including, but not limited to: Jay Z, Nelly, and Dave Matthews), homoeroticism, Natty Light, and whatever Mtv bullshit they readily swallow. Since the names in the Greek alphabet are multisyllabic, they often shorten their designations to grunts. For example ""Lambda Sigma"" is far too complex for their feeble minds, and it would thus be changed to ""Lam Sig"" and followed by the obligatory ""yo."" Fratboys can be identified by their steroid-induced bulk, backwards preworn hats with their Fraternity designations on them, and wardrobe exclusively bought from either Structure, American Eagle, or Abercrombie and Fitch. Fratboys and those women who associate with them should be gassed."

Crime is also very low indeed.Sutton is well known for it's fabulous schools. It has 5 grammar schools, all of which are truely brilliant and one of which is in the top 10 of all schools in the UK. Even the comprehensives are significantly above average, Cheam High School springs to mind swiftly.As far as shopping goes; Sutton caters well.It has a large Next, a very large Debenhams, Waterstones, HMV, Costa, Starbucks, Cafe' Nero, BHS, M&S, WH Smith, Clinton cards etc.It also has a large selection of great restaurants (most of which are near Sutton station) Some of these include: Pizza Express, Zizzi, Il Ponte, Prezzo and Brassie Vasherin which is run by Malcolm John, a renowned chef.You may have heard of Sutton's fantastic library. It's won many awards and is set on 3 large storeys. It included a childrens library, a cafe, a music and dvd floor and an IT suite. It was built in the 1970's but was extensively refurbished in 2004.I would certainly recommend Sutton to a friend, or indeed anyone out there who apprieciates a pleasent, good value suburban area with easy and fast access to C.

the ramones,"The Ramones were a hugely influential punk rock band, formed in Forest Hills, Queens, New York in January 1974. They played their first concert at the Performance Studio in New York on March 30, 1974. They led the New York punk movement and are often credited with forming the musical foundation of punk (see protopunk). The original band members all adopted Ramone as a surname although they were not actually brothers:Joey Ramone (May 19, 1951 - April 15, 2001) (real name Jeffrey Hyman) (vocals) Johnny Ramone (October 8, 1948 - September 15, 2004) (real name John Cummings) (guitar) Dee Dee Ramone (September 18, 1952 - June 5, 2002) (real name Douglas Glenn Colvin) (bass guitar) (1974-1989) Tommy Ramone (January 29, 1952) (real name Thomas Erdelyi) (drums) (1974-1978) Later band members also adopted the name:Marky Ramone (July 15, 1956) (real name Marc Bell) (Later replaced Tommy and Elvis on drums) (1978-1983, 1987-1996) Richie Ramone (August 11, 1957) (real name Richard Reinhardt) (Later replaced Marky on drums) (1983-1987) Elvis Ramone (November 24, 1955) (real name Clem Burke) (Later replaced Richie on drums) (1987) C.J. Ramone (October 8, 1965) (real name Christopher John Ward) (Later replaced Dee-Dee on bass) (1989-1996) An earlier member, Ritchie, left the band before the first recording (not related to the Richie Ramone, above). ""Here lies Ritchie Ramone"" can be seen on a cartoon drawing of a gravestone on the innersleeve of the 'Rocket to Russia' albumColvin (Dee Dee Ramone) suggested the name, inspired by the fact that Paul McCartney used to call himself Paul Ramone (although some accounts say Paul Ramon) when he was in the Silver Beatles.The Ramones pioneered a straightforward, stripped-down sound that was a far cry from the virtuosic musicianship and complex instrumentation that 1970s rock music had become known for. It heralded a raw, loud, fast and direct sound often reminiscent of 1950s-early 1960s rock and roll or bubblegum pop. Joey Ramone has stated the Ramones were rather taken with the Bay City Rollers' hit song ""Saturday Night,"" and set out to imitate its catchy, sing-a-long quality."

Anthony,"My name is Anthony, and for the most part the other definitions are true. Although if I'm supposed to be a hunk then why am I still single? I've only had one girlfriend, so I'm not sure how accurate that part of the definition is. It is true though that I am devoted to any girlfriend I get, and yes I love to act stupid. I'm very intelligent, but unfortunately only 25% italian. I hve a very complex mind that no one has ever completely figured out. I'm very good at hiding emotions with other emotions, and I am extremely trustworthy. I'm determined, persistent and yes at times stubborn. I could never hurt anyone, so yes, I was the one to get dumped. I'm very passionate about most things, and I would do anything for a friend. Making people laugh is my favorite thing to do, but sometimes I just like to relax. I wouldn't call myself a good kisser, but I have been told other wise. I'm addicted to kissing and hugging my girlffriend when I get one. Once is never enough. I let the girl decide the boundries for the most part, but I have boundries of my own. I underestimate myself, but if someone else underestimates me I'm sure to prove them wrong. I'm a patient caring guy, but if I do get pushed too far it is best to stand clear. I'm shy especially around girls, and around friends I tend to be a little perverted. I could continue on all night talking about me, but I'd rather hear about someone else. People mise well accept that they will never fully understand me."
fall out boy,"The name is derived from the television show, [The Simpsons], Fallout Boy is the young sidekick to the Superhero, Radioactive Man. Like Robin is to Batman.The band Fall Out Boy is currently(2005-06) very popular. However, they give what is quite possibly the worst live performance of any major record label band currently out. The guitarist and bassist insist on being in constant motion while on stage, including jumping in 360's, getting on top of amps, and jumping off of stage platforms, even though they are physically incapable of continuing to play correctly while doing so. The lead singer/second guitarist can neither sing, nor play guitar well, much less perform both tasks at the same time. This produces a stage sound and presence which is highly unnatractive, and very unpleasant to the ear.Their songs are pop-driven, somewhat simple, yet varied, and feature many catch phrases that will be branded all over your friends' [AIM] profiles and [Myspace]s for the next few months. Examples: ""Drop a heart, break a name""""I'm just a notch in your bedpost, but you're just a line in this song""""Sugar, we're going down""""We'r always siffee ee eida sefehh fodah roongg teeee""As the last quote demonstrates, most of their lyrics, even on the studio tracks, are indiscernible to the common person's ear. But not the 8th and 9th grade girls. They can mysteriously hear all of the lyrics and find great, deep meanings in them. "

Marxism,"Marxism is the name given to the set of political, social, philosophical and economic analyses formulated by Karl Marx and his close friend Friedrich Engles during the 19th Century - ideas which remain influential across the world today.The basic tenets of Marxist thought hold that history is best understood in terms of class struggle and that the material forces of production in a society forms the dominating influence on the cultural/ideological superstructure of any given society - the mode of production determines the mode of life; for example a nomadic peoples culture will be centred around journeying to find fresh food and pasture, wheras a settled agricultural peoples society will be formed on the basis of their own mode of production. The dominant class in a society, which appropriates the surplus economic product of that society creates and supports the dominant ideology of their society, reinforcing their posisition at its top.The surplus product of a society is the unpaid labour of the working classes - all those who do not own the means of production and whom must sell their labour in return for wages in order to survive. Capitalists buy this labour under its value which create profit. Eventually this leads to a crisis of 'overproduction' ofteb referred to as a 'recession' or 'slump', at which point the workers are abandoned as they are not employed for either a social need or for personal satisfaction - but for the generation of greater profits.A Marxist state has never existed and is an oxymoron, as is Communist State, etc etc.Marxism is a democratic ideology, beleiving that only the movement of the vast majority in individual nations and accross the world can overturn capitalism and create a world organised to provide for need, where a person is not tied like a serf forever to one job no matter how demeaning or pointless and where people give and take ""From each according to his ability, to each according to his need""."

Pocky was an instant hit among Japanese teenagers, and brought in sales of 30 billion yen in its first two years. The name was changed to ""Pocky"", after the Japanese onomatopoetic word for the sound Pocky makes when bitten, pokkin. The original was followed by ""Almond Pocky"" in 1971, with an almond coating, and ""Strawberry Pocky"" in 1977. Today, the product line includes such variations as milk, mousse, green tea and coconut flavored coatings, and themed products such as ""Decorer Pocky"", with colorful decorative stripes in the coating, and ""Men's Pocky"", a dark (bittersweet) chocolate and ""mature"" version.Pocky is very popular in Japan. In bars, it is sometimes served in a glass of ice water. It also has a significant presence in other East Asian countries such as China and Korea. In Europe, Pocky is renamed Mikado after the game Mikado. In the United States and Canada, Pocky can be found in Asian supermarkets and the international section of most large supermarkets, as well as Wal-Mart Supercenters and anime convention dealers' rooms. In Malaysia, Pocky was renamed by the Glico Company as Rocky, perhaps to avoid a vulgar word in Malay with similar pronunciation. Pocky has recently been marketed in America by LU, a company of the Danone Group.Outside of Japan, Pocky is fairly popular among Japanophiles and otaku (anime fans). Its constant association with the Engrish phenomenon and the oddness of some of its versions (like the ""Men's Pocky"" bittersweet flavor), as well as the several Pocky parodies seen on many anime/manga series, contribute to the snack's reputation."

Harry Potter,"A bestselling fantasy book and film series written by English author J.K. Rowling.Originally intended to be a children's book series. However, the intelligent and whimsical world of a boy who's miserable life suddenly transforms around him into an epic journey through a fantastic world of wizards, witches and mystical creatures, where every aspect (regardless of how small) is magical, has attained the incredibly rare achievement of accessibility to readers of any age.    The central story follows Harry Potter as he attends the wizarding school Hogwarts, located outside of Hogsmeade, Scotland. The stories revolve around Harry's interaction and exploration of a world parallel to our own, filled with magical foods, vehicles, monsters and sports.   The story's primary challenge and danger, lies in the return of a powerful, old enemy who had destroyed Harry's immediate family. Leaving him marked by a scar on his forehead.       Each of the seven books in the series represents a single ""year"" at Hogwarts. Each containing an episodic challenge that is to be overcome, whilst maintaining a coherent plot which encompasses the entirety of the series. Every book also features the three main protagonists coping with the gradual changes of puberty and social responsibility, as their eyes are opened to the, often times, harsh world around them. Every book also reveals more about the world itself, including traditions, other schools and life outside of school.      Pivotal are his relationships with these two friends: Hermione Granger (A know it all bookworm) and Ronald Weasley (Harry's earnest, faithful best friend)   Like most of the characters in the series, both Ron and Hermione gradually evolve past these initial stereotypes into rich characters and change drastically as they become adults.    All an all, a very enjoyable book series that becomes increasingly darker and deeper as one progresses through the series. Very rarely does an author create a world that is really cool AND that the reader would actually want to live in and be part of. "

Cold War,"The Cold War began following the end of World War II when the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR or the Soviet Union) emerged as the world's two superpowers, and subsequently the world's greatest prick-waving competition began.At the end of World War II Europe lay in ruins. The Soviet Union took hand to several Eastern European countries while the United States and Britain took on the Western and some southern countries. Many countries, such as Greece at the end of WWII which were occupied by the Nazis fell into civil war with two sides fighting against each other, each taking the influence of either Western political ideals or Soviet ideals. Once everything was set, there were now two sides: half of Europe under the influence of Western policies and the other half under Soviet. The two sides opposed each other and as the two sole superpowers, worked to try and gain the sphere of political influence on the world. Communism spreading and the United States working frantically to try and contain it in a series of proxy wars. And so began what would be known as the world's biggest and greatest prick-waving competition in excistence.To put it in a nutshell, at the start of the Cold War, the United States, and it's capitalistic ideals, and the Soviet Union, with it's communist ideals, both had just about equally sized penises. It was now a battle to impress the world of which had the bigger penis in order to try and influence it. The US and USSR went at it for the next fifty odd years.NATO was formed in 1949, thus making the United States' penis growing slightly larger than the USSR's. NATO was basically an agreement between several countries in defense to any enemy attack. The USSR suddenly felt emasculated by the size of the United States' penis and thus made a plan to extend their own by forming the Warsaw Pact in 1955. The Warsaw Pact was the USSR's response mostly to West Germany being signed into NATO and felt the need of creating it in strategic defense. Tensions grew between the two superpowers due in part by the fact that by the 1950s the world was now fully realized that the USSR was developing nuclear weapons and testing then (the first nuclear bomb test in the USSR was ""First Lightning, or RDS-1, nicknamed by the US ""Joe 1"" after a nickname given to Joseph Stalin, who was still ruler of the USSR at the time until his death in 1953.) , trying to out-nuke the US and showing them that they indeed, had the larger cock now. This lead to an increase in nuclear development in the United States, in order to try and catch up to it's arch-enemy and keep itself from getting pulverized by it's throbbing manhood.The United States had been developing nuclear weapons long before the Soviet Union had, it's first nuclear test ""Trinity"" on July 16, 1945 under the ""Manhattan Project."" The nuclear weapons were developed throughout WWII out of fear of discovery of it's power being discovered by Nazi Germany, and felt they needed to create them ASAP. By the end of WWII, Germany had been defeated along with several of it's alliances and Japan was the sole Axis power remaining. The Soviet Union declared war on Japan and the United States initially devised a plan called ""Operation Downfall"" which would have been the invasion of Japan. At that time, though, they'd just squeezed out years of research and development on nuclear weapons initially focused on Germany, but since Germany had already been defeated, they must have figured ""Eeehh, fuck it"" and dropped two buckets 'o sunshine on Japan. Nagasaki and Hiroshima were bombed to shit. There is much debate to this day about either or not nuclear weapons should have been used or not. In it's defense it was believed that casualties would have been drastically high for an initial invasion of Japan. The US continued to do several atomic bomb tests, many at Bikini Atoll in the Marshall Islands not long after the rapage of Hiroshima and Nagasaki by the US's massive penis at the time. The tests were conducted mostly to test the effects of nuclear weapons at sea.Anyways, now we're at an arms race in nuclear power between the Soviets and the Americans to show the world who had the bigger cock and who should follow their political influence, because they just assumed everyone else wanted a big cock, too. The arms race escalated with the US and the Soviet Union developing their largest nuclear weapons. The US with Castle Bravo, the blast yield of which was between 15-22 megatons, detonated at Bikini Atoll on February 24, 1954. At the time this was the largest detonated nuclear bomb, several times larger than the Fat Man and Little Boy bombs dropped on Japan spreading fear in the world about where it was going in terms of abusing the power of science and nuclear weapons.The Soviet Union, on the other hand, didn't give a fuck. The United States expanding the size of their penis with Castle Bravo? HAH! They could show them just how massive the cock of communism could be. They developed the ""Tsar Bomba"", also codenamed ""Ivan."" I don't exaggerate when I say this bomb was one mean motherfucker. To date, Tsar Bomba is the largest nuclear weapon ever detonated at 50 megatons. The explosion let out by Tsar Bomba in comparison made Nagasaki look like a tiny speck on the horizon. The Tsar Bomba was originally going to be 100 megatons, but the Soviets at the last minuet changed it to 50 for safety reasons. SAFETY REASONS. It was unleashed on October 30, 1961 on Novaya Zemlya.It's important to remember that the Cold War wasn't soley reliant on nuclear power extending the two superpowers' cocks, but other methods of proving one was superior to the other. One of these were the Space Race.One dream was to explore space. This became one of the central focuses of the Cold War when the Soviets got a head start by launching the Sputnik 1 into space on October 4, 1957 and also sent the first man into space, Yuri Gagarin on April 12, 1961.It's accepted that the Space Race officially began with the launch of the Sputnik. For years the United States believed that it had a bigger cock than the Soviet Union because it believed it was the leader of the space program, despite two failed attempts to get into space. So when the Sputnik first launched to the surprise of the US, Americans went absolutely and completely batshit insane. It became immediately emasculated at viewing how huge the Soviets' Pumping Pole of Communist Power had become it immediately began work vigorously on trying to out-man the Soviets with it's own space program, eventually sending the first man on the moon on July 20, 1969, making the Soviet Union feeling emasculated and flacid. Some believe the moon landing was faked in order to show the world that America had a bigger cock than the Soviets in order to gain influence.The Cold War also wasn't just between the US and the USSR. The US fought a series of proxy wars to contain the spread of Communism but they usually ended up in mediocre victories or massive failures altogether. Such is with the Korean War, in which North Korea fought for Communism and the US sided with the South. It was like a game of tug of war, one side got really far south, the other eventually got really far north, then they just got to the middle and said ""Fuck it"" and left. History repeated itself with Vietnam, North fighting for Communism, US siding with the South, blah blah blah. The US got a bloody nose, became flacid and ran away. Some also believe that President Kennedy was assassinated so Lyndon B. Johnson could go to war with Vietnam to contain the spread and influence of Communism.The Cold War eventually ended in victory for the United States, when the Soviet Union's cock got so big it eventually got erectile dysfunction and then proceeded to shit all over itself like a dying star as a result. The Soviet Union collapsed under Gorbachev, Ukraine, the Baltic States, Belarus and others became independent again, the Russian Mafia took the oppertunity to rise in Russia's broken government in times of recovery (but still holds the most nuclear weapons in the world). And now the United States is the sole superpower in the world, always going on and on about how massive it's dick is and proceeding to shove it's dick in other countries' faces when they don't really want it to.I could go on and on. Honestly. So much shit occurred during the Cold War between the US and the USSR and their battle for global influence but this page would go on forever. Pick up a book on the Cold War if your interested. Get the chance to read about the world's greatest and largest prick-waving competition."

Coos Bay is home to Southwestern Oregon Community College, an Indian Casino, nearby world class golf, Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area, Steve Prefontaine and a whole lot of Meth.Downtown Coos Bay has many tourist amenities, including a boardwalk, pedestrian mall, coffee shops, bistros, the Coos Art Museum and Mingus Park; but is surounded by vast slums such as Empire (home to the area's one and only Wal*Mart), Bunker Hill, Englewood and Barview. Here crime is rampant, drug production thrives and drunken wife beating is the norm. These areas are also where a majority of the town's murders take place.Coos Bay is also home to many fine beaches. Nearby are Sunset Bay, Cape Arago, Basendorff and Horsefall beaches. These beaches are usually empty and pristine, due to the constant wind and fog that characterizes the area's climate. Those who decide to brave the cool weather sometimes hold bonfires but are usually stopped, illegally searched and fined by the fascist local county and state police, who instead of focusing on the rampant crime forementioned, prefer to prevent young adults from having any sort of fun at the beach. Demographics:There are 15,374 people residing in the city, comprising 6,497 households and 4,028 families. The racial makeup of the city is 90.00% White, 0.00% African American, 0.00% Asian, 0.00% Pacific Islander, 0.00% from other races, and 0.00% from two or more races. 10% of the population are Mexicans. Of the whites, 92.15% are classified as White Trash Hillbillies.""The per capita income for the city is $16,158. 36.5% of the population and 32.7% of families are below the poverty line. Coos Bay is a religious, conservative stronghold in the otherwise progressive Pacific Northwest. In 2004, 90.76% of the population were registered as republicans, 4% as democrats and 4% as members of the Constitution Party. In 2003, during the onset of the war in Iraq, Coos Bay city council held a vote to ban the French Flag from city property. In 2006, members of the white trash hillbillie community held a ""We can live without you, Mexicans"" rally. A survey in 2006 concluded a large 97.5% ""hates queers,"" and 89.25% ""hates minorities."" Coos Bay is also notorious for being some 2,500 miles from the South, yet the Confederate Flag can bee seen almost everywhere. "

Binghamton is situated in a bowl shaped valley at the confluence of the Chenango and Susquehanna Rivers and is home to Binghamton University of the State University of New York system. After a mild turn-of-the-century presence as a manufacturing center of shoes and cigar materials, Binghamton suffered a precipitous decline in fortunes beginning with the loss of its core manufacturing base in the years following the war and consummating in the closing of its high-tech industries in the late 1980's and early 1990's. From a post-war population high of about 80,000, Binghamton has now shed nearly half of its population.Binghamton was the home of Rod Serling, host of the 1960's now cult-status television series ""The Twilight Zone"". The city and region suffered a devastating flood in the summer of 2006.

Unlike little teenybopper bands around now like Green Day and My Chemical Romance, Dave Mustaine's band, Megadeth, plays a little thing called music. He was kicked out of Metallica after writing a large portion of their better music (a lot of stuff off Kill 'Em All and Ride the Lightning) but never received credit. Metallica is an awesome band as well, but in my eyes Megadeth will always be superior. Dave Mustaine is known for being one of, if not THE, best rhythm guitarists of all time. He can write symphonies of complex low-end riffing and put in screaming melodies and incredible lead breaks in the same 10 seconds.

Yes, our government and job market is shit. Much of the accusations are true. However, as an American, I don't appreciate predominantly European people generalizing everybody in my country. I am ashamed at many of the things my countrymen have done throughout history, but it is also a country of equality, where anybody can make something of themself if they work hard enough. Home to some of the greatest musicians, inventors, and scientists of all time. And not to be an ignorant American, but we did help greatly in World War Two. Trying to ""hog some glory""? More like winning essential battles, including Normandy (perhaps the most important battle of WWII) with the help of the British and Canadians, of course. Even though Europe was in an enormous state of turmoil, and we helped the Allies greatly, they cannot show gratitude, they can only judge us even more. And let me be perhaps the first in a long while to say: France, thank you for your tremendous help during the Revolution, we wouldn't have won it without you. I write this with the utmost respect for European countries, please respect us a little more, and don't just recognize the bad things about the USA, but the good things as well, as I do."

Auburn,"Pleasant town in east Alabama where I went to grad school.

On the Fall Line (separating the hills from the coastal plains): half an hour north and you are in the hills; half an hour south and you are in swamps complete with cypress trees, Spanish moss, alligators and thousands of lily pads. The town is centered largely around Auburn University. The University tries to copy the University of Georgia and the University of Florida though denies it vehemently; and has an unbridled contempt and disdain for the University of Alabama, which it regards as an intellectual backwater out near Mississippi. There are an inordinate number of students who (like me) are from Buckhead, Vinings, East Cobb, Roswell and Dunwoody. The town, too, has quite a high opinion of itself – viewing itself as more sophisticated and ""white collar"" than the nearby “blue collar” towns of Columbus, Georgia and Montgomery, Alabama."
