An Alexa skill that queries [Urban Dictionary](http://www.urbandictionary.com/) to give the definitions of terms

A link to the published skill on the Amazon store is here: https://www.amazon.com/Karl-I-Modern-Dictionary/dp/B074J3J9VJ


<h3> How it Works: </h3>

The user first queries the skill asking for a random defintion. The skill then uses the Urban Dictionary API and makes a call to a random definition which returns the word and its definition. Then it gets formateed and returned to the device to be spoken aloud to the user.

Note: The Alexa certification does not allow explicit words, so a modified version of the skill has been made which censors out explicit words before returning them. 

<h3> Planned added features: </h3>

* Asking the user if they would like to save the word which would show a card in the Alexa app with the word and definition listed plus a link to it on Urban Dictionary.
* Allowing the users to ask for the definition to specific words instead of only giving a random one.
